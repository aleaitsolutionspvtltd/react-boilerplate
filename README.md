## Project Name & Pitch

React Boilerplate: A Pre-Developed React Application

This project offers a pre-developed React application with all the necessary packages pre-configured, providing a solid foundation for building dynamic and user-friendly web applications.


## Project Status

All required packages have been installed. Docker implementation is planned for the near future, along with the design of basic user pages.

## Features 

### Quick scaffolding
Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!

### Instant feedback
Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!

### Predictable state management
Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.

### Next generation JavaScript
Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.

### Next generation CSS
Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.

### Industry-standard routing
It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.
